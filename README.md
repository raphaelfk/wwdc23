## About
PawTask is an app that teaches users some basic principles about organization and that helps them manage their tasks and plan their day. You'll be introduced to the app features by Cooper, the app's dog, and, after adding your tasks, and organizing them by priority, the app can plan which tasks you'll be able to do in the time you have for the day!

This aplication can help people by doing most of their planning automatically, saving them time, that can be better spent with friends, family or getting ahead of their tasks, while also providing more peace of mind and reducing daily anxiety.

The app still does not fully support dark mode.
